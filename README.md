# Purwadhika Study Journal

This repository contains my study result and examination answers during my study of Data Science and Machine Learning at [Purwadhika Startup and Coding School](https://www.purwadhika.com).

During my study I was mentored by [Cornelius Yudha Widjaya](https://id.linkedin.com/in/cornellius-yudha-wijaya).
The Data Science and Machine Learning course at Purwadhika Startup and Coding School consist of three main topics which are as follows:

**1. Python Programming Overview**

This topic discusses about the fundamentals of programming with [python](https://www.python.org).

**2. Data Science**

This topic discusses about data query, data wrangling, data visualization, data analysis, how to use APIs and dashboard development. There are so many libraries and applications used for this topic. The libraries and applications are listed below.
- [numpy](https://numpy.org)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)
- [SQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-statements.html)
- [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/reference/)
- [dash](https://dash.plot.ly)
- [tableau](https://www.tableau.com)

**3. Machine Learning**

This topic discusses about the concept of machine learning and it's applications. Similar to the previous topic, there are a lot of libraries used in this topic. The libraries are listed below.
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) used for data preprocessing, data decomposition, predictive analysis, classification, and clustering.
- [pydotplus](https://github.com/carlos-jenkins/pydotplus) used for decision tree visualization.
- [imblearn](https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) used to deal with imbalanced labels in the dataset.
- [eli5](https://pypi.org/project/eli5/) used to analyze blackbox classifier models by doing permutation importance.
- [SHAP: SHapley Additive exPlanations](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) used to analyze blackbox classifier.
- [HDBSCAN](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_hdbscan_works.html) used for hdbscan clustering.
- [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) used for developing gradient based supervised models.

The Data Science and Machine Learning course at Purwadhika Startup and Coding School also assigns every student with a final project.
In the final project, students are encouraged to apply the lessons learned during the course as well as exploring other libraries which are used to support the final project.
My final project can be accessed [here](https://github.com/gstdl/Brazilian_e-Commerce_Exploartory_Data_Analysis_and_Machine_Learning)

During the course I also managed to learned other useful libraries. The libraries are listed below.
- [yellowbrick](https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/) used for machine learning visualiztion.
- [mlrose: Machine Learning, Randomized Optimization and SEarch](https://pypi.org/project/mlrose/) used to solve a Traveling Salesman Problem in my [final project](https://github.com/gstdl/Brazilian_e-Commerce_Exploartory_Data_Analysis_and_Machine_Learning)
- [lightgbm](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) similar to XGBoost but supports parallel and GPU learning.

Besides of exams and learning new libraries, during my study I also did some group studies which can be found [here](https://github.com/gstdl/Purwadhika_Group_Assignments)
